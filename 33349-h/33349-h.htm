<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p class="dropcap">This production of the Shepherd Psalm is sent forth at the request of
many hundreds of kind persons who have listened to the writer preach on
it and who desire to see it in print, that it may be a blessing to many
who cannot hear it.</p>

<p>It is a well known Psalm. Untold numbers of sermons have been preached
on it. Books without number have been printed in attempts to set forth
its life, depth, richness, and beauty. Doubtless much more will be
written and spoken concerning this charming pastoral symphony&mdash;and,
after that, much more will remain yet to be said, so full is the
inspiration of the divine Word. May God make this Psalm to the reader
all that it has been&mdash;yea, and more,&mdash;to the writer!</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<h3>The Twenty-third Psalm</h3>


<p class="dropcap">The world could afford to spare many a
magnificent library better than it could
dispense with this little Psalm of six
verses. If the verses of this Psalm had tongues
and could repeat the tale of their ministry
down throughout the generations of the faithful,
what marvels of experience they would
reveal! Their biographies would be gathered
from the four winds of heaven and from the
uttermost parts of the sea; from lonely chambers,
from suffering sick beds, from the banks
of the valley of the shadow of death, from scaffolds
and fiery piles; witnessing in sunlight
from moors and mountains, beneath the stars
and in high places of the field. What hosts of
armies of aliens it has put to flight! If by
some magic or divine touch, yea, some miraculous
power, the saints' experience of this
Psalm could shine out between its lines, what
an illumination of the text there would be!</p>

<p>Luther was fond of comparing this Psalm to
the nightingale, which is small among the
birds and of homely plumage, but with what
thrilling melody it pours out its beautiful
notes! Into how many dungeons filled with
gloom and doubt has this little Psalm sung its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[<i>Page</i> 8]</a></span>
message of hope and faith! Into how many
hearts, bruised and broken by grief, has it
brought its hymn of comfort and healing
How many darkened prison cells it has lightened
and cheered! Into what thousands of
sick rooms has it brought its ministry of comfort
and support! How many a time, in the
hour of pain, has it brought sustaining faith
and sung its song of eternal bliss in the valley
of the shadow of death! It has charmed more
griefs to rest than all the philosophies of the
world. And I am persuaded that this little
Psalm-bird will continue to sing its song of
comfort and cheer to your children, to my children,
and to our children's children, and will
not cease its psalmody of love until the last
weary pilgrim has placed his last climbing
footstep upon the threshold of the Father's
house to go out no more. Then, I think, this
little bird will fold its golden pinions and fall
back on the bosom of God, from whence it
came.</p>

<p>It has been well said that this Psalm is the
most perfect picture of happiness that ever was
or ever can be drawn to represent that state of
mind for which all alike sigh, and the want of
which makes life a failure to most. It represents
that heaven which is everywhere, if we
could but interpret it, and yet almost nowhere
because not many of us do.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[<i>Page</i> 9]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>Unusual Application</i></b></div>

<p>How familiar this Psalm is the
world over! Go where you
will; inquire in every nation,
tongue and tribe under heaven where the Bible
is known, you will find this Psalm among the
first scriptures learned and lisped by the little
child at its mother's knee, and the last bit of
inspired writ uttered in dying breath by the
saintly patriarch.</p>

<p>This Psalm is so universal, says one, because
it is so individual; it is so individual because
it is so universal. As we read it, we are aware
not only of the fact that we are listening to the
experience of an Old Testament saint, but also
that a voice comes speaking to us through the
long centuries past&mdash;speaking to us in our own
language, recounting our own experience,
breathing out our own hopes.</p>

<p>The Davidic authorship of this Psalm has
been questioned. We believe firmly that
David is the writer; and yet a man feels as he
reads the Psalm that it is so personal, so true
to his own individual experience, that he could
fain claim to have written it himself. It might
seem as though the promises and precious
things set forth in this Psalm lie beyond our
reach; we have nothing to draw with, and the
well is deep, but "one of like passions with
ourselves has passed that way before and has
left a cup to be let down, with His name and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[<i>Page</i> 10]</a></span>
story written on the rim, and we may let that
cup down into the well and draw a draught of
the deep, refreshing water."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>The Location
of the
Psalm</i></b></div>

<p>Have you ever noticed just
where this Psalm is located?
It lies between the Twenty-second
and the Twenty-fourth
Psalms. A very simple statement that&mdash;but
how deep and wondrous a lesson lies hidden
therein!</p>

<p>The Twenty-second Psalm. What is it? It
is "The Psalm of the Cross." It begins with
the words uttered by Christ on the cross: "My
God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"
It ends with the exclamation of the cross: "He
hath done it," or, as it may be translated, "It is
finished." The Twenty-second Psalm, then, is
the Psalm of Mount Calvary&mdash;The Psalm of
the Cross.</p>

<p>What is the Twenty-fourth Psalm? It is
the Psalm of Mount Zion&mdash;a picture of the
King entering into His own. How beautifully
it reads: "Lift up your heads, O ye gates;
and be ye lifted up, ye everlasting doors; and
the King of glory shall come in. Who is this
King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the
King of glory." The Twenty-fourth Psalm,
then, is the Psalm of the coming Kingdom of
Glory.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[<i>Page</i> 11]</a></span></p>

<p>There you have the two mountains; Mount
Calvary and Mount Zion. What is it that lies
between two mountains? A valley with its
green grass, its quiet waters, its springing flowers,
with shepherd and grazing sheep. Here,
then, is the lesson we learn from the <i>location</i> of
the Psalm: it is given to comfort, help, inspire
and encourage God's people during this probationary
period of our life, between the Cross
and the Crown.</p>

<p>Is not this the reason why the tenses of this
Psalm are <i>present</i> tenses? "The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> <i>is</i> my
shepherd"; "He <i>maketh</i> me to lie down"; "He
<i>leadeth</i> me." Even the last verse, "<i>I will</i> (not
I shall) dwell in the house of the Lord for
ever," describes the <i>present</i> attitude of the soul
of the Psalmist, who determines by no means
to miss participation in the fellowship of the
saints in heaven.</p>

<p>We love <i>the Christ of the Cross</i>. We may
not yet fully understand that cross; may not
yet have found any particular theory of the
atonement which completely satisfies our intellect.
But we have learned to say that we believe
in the atonement and in the vicarious
death of our Redeemer. Somehow or other we
have come, by faith, to throw our trembling
arms around that bleeding body and cry out in
the desperate determination of our sin-stricken
souls to Him who hangs on that cross to save<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[<i>Page</i> 12]</a></span>
us by His death. We have come to express
our faith in that divine sacrifice in the words
of the hymn:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Other refuge have I none,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hangs my helpless soul on Thee.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Let us never forget that we reach the
Twenty-third Psalm by the way of the
Twenty-second Psalm&mdash;the Psalm of the
Cross. "The way of the cross leads home."
We love the Christ of the Twenty-second
Psalm, the Christ of Calvary, the Christ of the
Cross.</p>

<p>We also love <i>the Christ of the Throne and
the Glory</i>. It may be, that, at times, we have
trembled and feared as we have thought of the
coming judgment, but when we have remembered
that He who sits upon the throne is our
Elder Brother, bone of our bone, and flesh of
our flesh; that He left His throne in the glory
and took on Him the form of a servant, dying
the ignominious death of the cross that He
might redeem us and save us from the just
wrath of God against sin; that some day, He
who loved us and gave Himself for us, will
say: "Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit
the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation
of the world," then we take courage and
look forward with joy to the time when, having
washed the last sleep from our eyes in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[<i>Page</i> 13]</a></span>
river of Life, we shall gaze with undimmed
vision upon Him, whom having not seen, we
have yet loved.</p>

<p>We love the Christ of the cross, the Christ
of the past, the Christ of Mount Calvary. We
love the Christ of the future, the Christ of the
throne, the Christ of Mount Zion. But more
precious to us, and we say it reverently, than
the Christ of the past, or the Christ of the
future, is the Christ of the present, He who
lives with us now, dwells within us, walks by
our side every moment and every hour of the
day. We used to sing in our childhood days
that beautiful hymn,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I think, when I read that sweet story of old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Jesus was here among men,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How He called little children as lambs to His fold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should like to have been with Him then.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I wish that His hands had been placed on my head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That His arms had been thrown around me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that I might have seen His kind look when he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Let the little ones come unto me."<br /></span>
</div><div class="signature">&mdash;<i>Mrs. Jemima Luke</i><br />
</div></div>

<p>Many of us feel that we would have given
anything to have walked by the side of the
Christ in the days of His earthly pilgrimage,
and we almost envy those who saw His face in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[<i>Page</i> 14]</a></span>
the flesh. Some of us know the thrill of joy
that came to our hearts when we trod the
sands of Galilee that once were fresh with His
footprints, trod the Temple's marble pavements
that once echoed with His tread, and
sailed the blue waters of Galilee that once
were stilled by His wonderful word.</p>

<p>And yet, we should not forget that the enjoyment
of the real presence of Christ is just as
truly ours today as it was the possession of
the disciples in the days of His flesh. As the
old hymn so beautifully says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">We may not climb the heavenly steeps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring the Lord Christ down;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain we search the lowest deeps,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For Him no depths can drown.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But warm, sweet, tender, even yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A present help is He;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And faith has still its Olivet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And love its Galilee.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The healing of His seamless dress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is by our beds of pain;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And we are whole again.<br /></span>
</div><div class="signature">&mdash;<i>John G. Whittier</i><br /></div></div>

<p>The name given to our Lord in connection

is, "God with us." One of the most

divine immanence, the continued presence of

<h2>THE SHEPHERD PSALM</h2>

<h2>CHAPTER ONE</h2>


<h3><b>"The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is my shepherd; I shall not want."</b></h3>



<p class="dropcap">"The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is my shepherd." Have you
ever noted how the word "Lord" is
printed in the Bible? Sometimes all
the letters are large capitals (LORD); or the
first letter is a large capital and the other letters
smaller capitals (<span class="smcap">Lord</span>); then, again, the
first letter is a large capital and the remaining
letters ordinary (Lord). Each method of spelling
the divine name indicates a different phase
of the character of God. "LORD" refers to
Jehovah as the covenant-keeping God, the One
who never fails to fulfill all His promises.
"<span class="smcap">Lord</span>" points to our Lord Jesus Christ as the
second Person in the Trinity, He who became
incarnate. "Lord" signifies also God in Christ,
the Jehovah of the Old Testament, God of
power, the One who is able to do all things
and with whom nothing is impossible, manifesting
Himself in Jesus Christ.</p>

<p>What a world of meaning, then, lies wrapped
up in the word "<span class="smcap">Lord</span>" in the first verse of this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[<i>Page</i> 18]</a></span>
Psalm! Jehovah who is all-faithful, never failing
in His promises, almighty, all-powerful,
who is able to supply all of our needs, who created
the heavens and the earth, who upholds
all things by the word of His power, who spake
and it was done, who commanded and it stood
fast; the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> of whom Job said: "I know
that thou canst do anything, and no purpose
of thine can be hindered"; the "<span class="smcap">Lord</span>" who
never fails in the keeping of His promises,
however seemingly impossible of fulfillment,
from a natural viewpoint, those promises may
be; the "<span class="smcap">Lord</span>" of whom it is said, "God is not
a man that he should lie, nor the Son of man
that he should repent." "Hath he said and
shall He not do it; hath He promised and shall
he not bring it to pass?" the "Lord," the incarnate
One, who for our sakes took on Himself
our nature with all its sinless infirmities, who
was tempted in all points like as we are, yet
without sin, and who is thus able to feel our
needs and sympathize with us in all our trials
and temptations; the "<span class="smcap">Lord</span>" who, speaking to
the multitudes, said, "I am the good shepherd;
the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep"&mdash;such
a Shepherd, faithful, powerful, sympathetic,
is our "<span class="smcap">Lord</span>." What a wealth of
meaning, then, lies in the first clause, "The
<span class="smcap">Lord</span>" (who is LORD, and Lord) such a
"<span class="smcap">Lord</span>" is "my Shepherd."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[<i>Page</i> 19]</a></span></p>

<p>We can then well say, "I shall not want."
With such a Shepherd, how could we want for
anything for time or eternity? All that we
need for body, mind and soul shall be supplied.
The God who provided the table in the wilderness,
who fed Elijah by the brook, who struck
the rock in the wilderness that the thirst of
His people might be quenched, will provide for
His children according to His riches in glory.</p>

<p>Reviewing Israel's history in the wilderness
it could be recorded, "These forty years Jehovah,
thy God, hath been with thee; thou hast
lacked nothing." How wonderfully God supplied
the needs of His people when they were
traveling through that long, weary wilderness!
"For the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God hath blessed thee in all
the works of thy hand; he knoweth thy walking
through this great wilderness; these forty
years the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God hath been with thee;
thou hast lacked nothing" (Deuteronomy 2:7).
"Thou gavest also thy good Spirit to instruct
them, and withheldest not thy manna from
their mouth, and gavest them water for their
thirst. Yea, forty years didst thou sustain
them in the wilderness, so that they lacked
nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their
feet swelled not" (Nehemiah 9:20, 21).</p>

<p>Let us, then, as the children of God, take all
the comfort possible out of these words. Let
us not go about mourning, grumbling, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[<i>Page</i> 20]</a></span>
borrowing trouble, thereby proclaiming to the
world that our great Banker is on the verge of
bankruptcy. The "<span class="smcap">Lord</span>" is our shepherd; we
shall not want for nourishment (verse 1), refreshment
(verse 2), rest (verse 3), protection
(verse 4), guidance (verse 5), home (verse 6).
Here is a Bank the child of God can draw on
at any time without fear of its being broken.
Millions have been supplied and there's room
for millions more. No want shall turn me
back from following the Shepherd.</p>

<p>How encouraging to recall the words of
Jesus uttered to the disciples when they had
returned from their itinerary of missionary
activity: "When I sent you without purse, and
scrip, and shoes, lacked ye any thing? And
they said, Nothing" (Luke 22:35).</p>

<p>When the writer was a lad he secured a position
for which he was promised so much a
week in money and "everything found," by
which was meant board, room, and clothing.
So this verse may read, "The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is my Shepherd,"
and "everything found."</p>

<p>In a park one day two women were overheard
talking. One of them, who by her ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[<i>Page</i> 21]</a></span>pearance
showed that she was in very straitened
circumstances, said to the other, "I am
at my wit's end; I know not what to do. My
husband has been sick and unable to work for
almost a year. What little money we had
saved is all spent. We have not a penny with
which to buy food or clothing for ourselves or
the children. This morning we received notice
from the landlord to vacate." And then, in
words that were full of suggestive meaning,
she added, "If John D. Rockefeller were my
father, I would not want, would I?"</p>

<p>Oh, what a world of comfort lies in the
thought, "The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is my Shepherd," and,
therefore, "I shall not want"! I shall want for
nothing in time or eternity. Every need of
body, mind, and soul shall be supplied. In the
great Shepherd lies strength for my weakness,
hope for my despair, food for my hunger, satisfaction
for my need, wisdom for my ignorance,
healing for my wounds, power for my temptation&mdash;the
complement of all my lack.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>Religion Is

<p>"The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is my shepherd."
<i>My</i> Shepherd. Religion is a
<i>personal</i> thing. Really speaking,
your religion consists in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[<i>Page</i> 22]</a></span>
your personal relationship to God in Jesus
Christ. Not mere profession, but actual possession
is what counts. Christianity emphasizes
the worth of the individual and his personal
relation to God. Sin degrades men into
mere numbers.</p>

<p>A photograph was placed on my desk. It
had inscribed on it a number, but no name.
It was the likeness of a convict. It was a number
I went to jail to see; a number I spoke
with by the cell door; a number I stood by
and saw handcuffed; a number with whom I
walked down the steps of the jail; a number
with whom I walked up the stairs to the scaffold;
a number around whose neck I saw the
rope placed; a number I saw drop to his death.
Sin degrades personality, but the religion of
Christ exalts its adherents to a place in that
innumerable company which cannot be numbered,
but every one of whom bears upon his
forehead the name of his Redeemer and King.
Jesus calleth <span class="smcap">His</span> sheep by name, not by
number.</p>

<p>At the close of a sermon in a church in the
Highlands of Scotland the preacher, who was
supplying the pulpit for a few Sundays, was
asked to call upon a shepherd boy who was
very sick. Arm in arm with one of the elders
of the church the minister crossed the moor,
climbed the hillside, and came to the cottage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[<i>Page</i> 23]</a></span>
where the boy and his widowed mother lived.
After knocking at the door the visitors were
admitted by the mother. Her face showed the
marks of long vigil. The boy was her only
child. The minister and elder went into the
room where the sick boy lay on his cot. The
minister, looking upon the pale, haggard face
of the sick shepherd boy, asked him tenderly,
"Laddie, do you know the Twenty-third
Psalm?"</p>

<p>Every Scotch boy knows the Twenty-third
Psalm, and so the little fellow replied, "Yes,
sir, I ken (know) the Psalm well."</p>

<p>"Will you repeat it to me?" said the minister
to the boy.</p>

<p>Slowly and tenderly the lad quoted the
words, "The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is my shepherd, I shall not
want," unto the end of the Psalm.</p>

<p>"Do you see," said the minister to the boy,
"that in the first clause of the first verse there
is just one word for each finger. Hold up your
hand, laddie; take the second finger of your
right hand, put it on the fourth finger of your
left, hold it over your heart and say with me,
'The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is <i>my</i> Shepherd.'"</p>

<p>The fourth finger of the left hand! Why
that finger? Every woman knows. It is the
ring finger. Who placed that ring on your
finger? My friend, my lover, my husband;
the man who is more to me and different to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[<i>Page</i> 24]</a></span>
me than any other and all other men in this
world; the man without whom life would not
be worth living; <i>my</i> friend, <i>my</i> lover, <i>my</i> husband.</p>

<p>The following Sunday the elder and the minister
again crossed the moor and came to the
cottage on the hillside. As the mother opened
the door to admit them they saw by the expression
on her face that a deeper sorrow had fallen
on her heart since they last saw her. She took
them, silently and solemnly, into a little room,
and there, covered with a snow-white sheet,
lay the lifeless form of the shepherd laddie,
her only child. As the minister took the white
sheet and passed it from forehead to chin, from
chin to breast, and from breast to waist, he
saw, frozen stiff in death, the second finger of
the right hand on the fourth of the left hand,
which was fastened in death over his heart.
The mother exclaimed amid her tears, "He died
saying, 'The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is <i>my</i> Shepherd.'"</p>

<p>What a world of difference that little word
<i>my</i> makes, does it not? As a pastor I have
often stood by the open grave that was to receive
the body of someone's beloved daughter,
the light and joy of some heart. I sought to
be deeply sympathetic with those who were
suffering bereavement. I tried to mourn with
those who mourned, and weep with those who
wept, and I think I did, so far as it is possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[<i>Page</i> 25]</a></span>
for a friend to sympathize. But one day I
stood by an open grave when <i>my</i> daughter, <i>my</i>
child, <i>my own</i> darling girl, <i>my</i> Dorothy, was
placed beneath the sod. Ah! then I knew what
grief was. Ah, what a world of difference that
little word <i>my</i> makes!</p>

<p>It will not profit you much, my friend, to be
able to say, "The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is <i>a</i> Shepherd"; you
must be more personal; you must say, "The
<span class="smcap">Lord</span> is <i>my</i> Shepherd."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWO</h2>

<h3>
<b>"He maketh me to lie down in green pastures;<br />
he leadeth me beside still waters."</b>
</h3>


<p class="dropcap">They tell us that it is a very difficult
and well-nigh impossible thing to get
a sheep that is hungry to lie down in a
pasture, or that is thirsty to drink by turbulent
waters. A hungry dog will, but not a hungry
sheep. The sheep described in this verse, then,
are such as have been fed and satisfied in richest
pastures, and whose thirst have been slaked
in quiet waters. Doubtless the mind of the
Psalmist is going back to such scenes in his
own shepherd life when he had led his flock
into rich, green pastures, sought out for his
sheep some quiet watering-place, or had so
manipulated the flow of turbulent waters as to
make them flow smoothly.</p>

<p>The writer of this Psalm is seeking to illustrate
spiritual truths from his own experience
as a shepherd among the hills of Judea. He is
spiritualizing his soliloquy. He thinks of the
cry of God's people for the satisfaction of the
soul's hunger and thirst; he sees the necessity
for such feeding and nourishment if there is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[<i>Page</i> 27]</a></span>
be a walk of obedience "in the paths of righteousness."</p>

<p>Spiritualizing this verse, we may say that
the "green pastures" and "still waters" refer
to the spiritual nourishment which the child
of God receives as he waits upon God in the
study of His Word and prayer. There can be
no spiritual strength sufficient to walk in
"paths of righteousness" unless time is taken
to "lie down" in the "green pastures" of the
divine Word by "the still waters" of prayer.
To "lie down" is the first lesson the Great
Shepherd would teach His sheep. Not lie
down after you are tired, but before. "Lie
down" that you may have strength to walk in
"the paths of righteousness." One of the hardest
commands for the soldier to obey is to wait
in the trenches. He would sooner "go over
the top."</p>

<p>It is generally recognized as being a very
difficult thing to get God's people to thus "lie
down." They will do almost anything and
everything else but that. They will run, walk,
fight, sing, teach, preach, work, in a word do
almost anything and everything except seek
seasons of quiet and periods of retirement for
secret communion with God and quiet soul
nurture.</p>

<p>Most of our favorite hymns indicate this
attitude. They are militant, working, active<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[<i>Page</i> 28]</a></span>
hymns: "Work, for the night is coming,"
"The fight is on," "Onward, Christian soldiers,
marching as to war," "Stand up, stand up for
Jesus," "Steadily marching on, with His banner
waving o'er us," and many another. Where
are such hymns as "Alone with Jesus, O the
hush, the rapture," "In the secret of His presence
how my soul delights to hide," "Take
time to be holy"? How few of us are willing
to go alone into the woods whither the Master
went, clean forspent, clean forspent?</p>

<p>We do not like pauses in our meetings. If
there should be a pause we seek at once to fill
it in with a verse of Scripture, or someone says,
"Let us sing a verse of hymn sixty-six," and so
we fill up the pauses with choruses.</p>

<p>From the rush into the hush Jesus calls us.
From the turbulent tumult into the quiet secret
of His presence. Where there is peace, perfect
peace, Jesus calls us.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Lie down we <i>must</i>. The text says, "He
<i>maketh</i> me to lie down." The word "maketh"
is the Hebrew causative and indicates forcible,
compelling action. Our Great Shepherd knows
that amid the activity, the stress, the strain
and the restlessness of our lives it is absolutely
necessary for us to take periods of quiet and
rest, without which it will be impossible for us
to continue in the way of righteousness. Have
you so much to do that you do not have time
to "lie down"? Then the gracious Shepherd
will see to it that you have less to do. He
would <i>make</i> you lie down. The overworked
watchspring snaps. There must be pauses and
parentheses in all our lives.</p>

<p>We make much today of <i>active</i> Christianity.
We lay emphasis on the <i>activities</i> of Church
work. Pragmatism is more than quietism to
us. We must "bring things to pass," and
"deliver the goods." This is all very well in
its place, but we fear that the strength of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[<i>Page</i> 30]</a></span>
activities is not very deeply rooted. We shall
be able to bear fruit upward and outward only
as the roots of our spiritual life grow downward
and deep. The secret springs of our
lives must be well cared for.</p>

<p>One day we read in the daily newspaper of
some leading man in the community who had
fallen and brought discredit on the cause of
Christ. This unfaithful one was described as
having been "an active member of the church."
Yes, that was the trouble. He was too active;
he was not passive enough. He had omitted
to "lie down" and feed in "green pastures" and
drink by the "still waters" of God's Word and
by prayer.</p>

<p>A friend tells us that while in the Orient he
visited a Syrian shepherd. He observed that
every morning the shepherd carried food to the
sheepfold. On inquiry he found that he was
taking it to a sick sheep. The next morning
the friend accompanied the shepherd and saw
in the sheepfold a sheep with a broken leg.
The friend asked the shepherd how the accident
happened. Was it struck by a stone?
Did it fall into a hole? Did a dog bite it?
How was the limb injured? The shepherd replied,
"No, I broke it myself."</p>

<p>In amazement the friend replied, "What, you
broke it! Why did you do that?"</p>

<p>The shepherd then told him how wayward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[<i>Page</i> 31]</a></span>
this sheep had been, how it had led others
astray, and how difficult it had been to come
near it. It was necessary that something
should be done to preserve the life of this particular
member of the flock, and also to prevent
it from leading other sheep astray. The
shepherd therefore broke its leg and reset it.
This breakage necessitated the sheep's <i>lying
down</i> for a week or more. During that time
it was compelled to take food from the hand
of the shepherd. Thus had the compulsion of
lying down cured the wandering and wayward
disposition of the sheep.</p>

<p>It is said that when a sheep will not follow
the shepherd he takes up the lamb in his
arms&mdash;and then the mother follows.</p>

<p>So it sometimes happens with the children
of God. Our Great Shepherd has to lay us
aside, put us on our backs, perhaps, for a while
in order that we may look up into His face and
learn needed lessons. A little girl lay dying.
She looked up into the face of her father, who
years before had been a very active church
worker, but on account of business prosperity
had drifted away from Christian moorings, and
said, "Papa, if you were as good as you used
to be, do you think I would have to die?" God
was <i>making</i> this man to "lie down," do you
see?</p>

<p>A deacon in a Baptist church told me this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[<i>Page</i> 32]</a></span>
story. When first married, he and his wife
observed family prayers every day. This worshipful
spirit continued for some years after
their first child was born; then gradually the
father became so engrossed in business that
the family altar, Bible reading and prayer were
gradually neglected and finally altogether dispensed
with. One day, on coming home from
the office, the deacon found his nine-year-old
girl very ill with a fever. For weeks they
watched over her, but finally the angel of death
took her home. As the deacon told me this
story, the tears filling his eyes, he said, "Then
I knew that my daughter had been taken for
my sake and that God was <i>making</i> me to 'lie
down.' From that day until this, which is over
a quarter of a century, the family altar has
been maintained in our home."</p>

<p>Mother, in that sweetest of all hours to a
mother, the last hour of the day when the child
is being put to sleep, when the last thing its
eyes rest upon is the face of the mother, does
its last vision rest on a mother who has taught
it to pray, to love Jesus? It would be infinitely
better that the heavenly Father take that little
child to be with Himself than that it should go
out into the world from a godless, Christless,
prayerless home.</p>

<p>Fathers and mothers, are we taking time to
"lie down," to be alone with God in prayer and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[<i>Page</i> 33]</a></span>
the reading of His Word? Has the family
altar in your home been neglected? What are
you waiting for? Do you want God to come
and lay His hand upon some precious one in
your family circle to take to be with Himself?
Would you then take time to "lie down"?</p>

<p>It is said that when a sheep is wayward and
will not cross the brook, the shepherd finds
that by taking the little lamb from it and carrying
it across, the mother sheep will at once
follow, rushing over the stream. Fathers and
mothers, are you waiting for God to do this?
Our fathers and mothers used to have the family
altar. They took time to read the Bible
and pray with their children. What kind of
age will the next be if we neglect these religious
privileges? It may be that our parents
were not the scholars that some of their children
are, but I think we may safely say that
they were the saints that we never will be until
we "lie down" in the green pastures and quiet
waters of God's Word and prayer as they did.</p>

<p>Christian workers especially need to learn
the lesson of "lying down," We are restless;
we fume and worry and fret because we are
tired and hungry. We do not take time to "lie
down." Strange, is it not, that we will do
almost anything but lie down? We will walk,
run, climb, sing, preach, teach&mdash;do anything
but "lie down." Let us not forget that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[<i>Page</i> 34]</a></span>
secret of power lies in being alone with God.
Christ <i>drew</i> the multitudes to Him because
He <i>withdrew</i> from them at times. The drawing
preacher is the withdrawing man. Significant
are the words of Jesus to His <i>active</i> disciples:
"Come ye yourselves apart into a
desert place, and rest a while."</p>

<p>These seasons of lying down are periods of
renewal of strength for duty, not for indolence
or mere ecstasy. By thus feeding in the green
pastures and drinking by the still waters, we
are strengthened in order that we may walk in
the paths of righteousness. We eat and drink
for strength, not for drunkenness. One may
lie in a bath so long that his strength is exhausted
thereby, or he may take a good plunge
in the morning which will be a source of exhilaration
to him throughout the day. These
times of "lying down" may be likened to the
plunge. We must not be mere recluses or
visionaries. Our "lying down" must fit us for
"walking." If our private communion with
God does not fit us for Christian activity in our
daily avocation, distrust it. We cannot keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[<i>Page</i> 35]</a></span>
the rapture of devotion if we neglect duty of
service. Life must not be all contemplation
any more than it must not be all activity. We
will not need to speak of these times of lying
down, nor advertise that we have seasons of
quiet communion, of ecstasy and vision; but
the result thereof will be clearly apparent in
our lives as we walk in the path of righteousness,
and in the joyful assurance of soul when
we are called upon to pass through the valley
of the shadow.</p>

<p>Would that we knew how much depended,
both for ourselves and others, on these seasons
of retirement for meditation and prayer!
What a blessing it would be to us! What a
benediction to others!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THREE</h2>

<h3>
<b>"He restoreth my soul; he leadeth me in the<br />
paths of righteousness for his<br />
name's sake."</b>
</h3>


<p class="dropcap">David, the shepherd Psalmist, is doubtless
thinking of the refreshment that
comes to the soul from browsing or
meditating in the green pastures and by the
still waters of the Word of God, and of the
exhilaration and inspiration that comes from
being alone with God with an open Bible and
on bended knee. Every true child of God
knows the strength and blessing that comes
from such fellowship and communion. "Even
the youths shall faint and be weary, and the
young men shall utterly fall; but they that
wait upon the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> shall renew their strength;
they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they
shall run, and not be weary; and they shall
walk, and not faint" (Isaiah 40:30, 31).</p>

<p>But the Psalmist is referring more particularly,
perhaps, to the restoration of the soul
from a spiritual lapse or backsliding, resulting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[<i>Page</i> 37]</a></span>
from failure to "lie down." We well know
from what we have read regarding the Oriental
shepherd life, that the shepherd must needs
be a physician as well as a guide. A sheep is
a most defenceless creature. A cat, horse, cow
or a dog will defend itself&mdash;a sheep cannot.
Sheep have a genius for going wrong. A sheep
is said to have less brains than any other animal
of its size. If lost, it cannot find its way
back unaided. A dog, a cat, a horse can, but
not a sheep. "All we, like sheep, have gone
astray." If the Good Shepherd had not gone
after us we would not have been in the fold
today.</p>

<p>Have you ever looked into a sheep's eyes?
They look for all the world like glass eyes. A
sheep can see practically nothing beyond ten
or fifteen yards. It recognizes persons by
sound and not by sight. Jesus said, "My sheep
hear my voice; a stranger will they not follow,
for they know not the voice of strangers."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>Traps for Falling</i></b></div>

<p>Palestinian fields were covered with
narrow criss-cross paths over which
the shepherd would have to lead his
flock in seeking new pasture. Some
of these paths led to a precipice or deep ravine
over which a stupid sheep might easily fall to
its death. From such dangers the shepherd had
to guard his flock. Some sheep, however, being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[<i>Page</i> 38]</a></span>
wayward by nature would take one of these
criss-cross paths leading to danger and fall
headlong into thickets or down ravines, where
they would lie wounded, bleeding and dying.
What does a stupid sheep know of ravines,
precipices or haunts of wild beasts? That hill
or valley seems to offer fair prospects and good
pasture&mdash;but death lurks there. The sheep
knows not. The shepherd would have to seek
the lost, wounded sheep, and, finding it, bind
up its wounds, reset broken limbs and restore
its health.</p>

<p>It is said that if a sheep wandered into a
stranger's pasture the finder could cut its
throat and keep the carcass, providing the
shepherd did not come in time to save the
sheep. Many times the shepherd arrived just
after the sheep had been mutilated, and by care
saved its life and restored it to health again.
The sheep was again his own&mdash;it was "restored."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>The Wandering Sheep</i></b></div>

<p>David is spiritually soliloquizing.
He thinks of the tendency
of human nature to err and
stray like a sheep. "All we like
sheep have gone astray; we have turned every
one to his own way." Man, too, has a genius
for going wrong. "There is a way that seemeth
right unto a man, but the end thereof are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[<i>Page</i> 39]</a></span>
the ways of death." No man is clever enough
to guide himself through the devious ways of
life. He needs God as a guide.</p>

<p>David recalls how tenderly God had dealt
with him after his backslidings and how graciously
and completely He had restored him
to fellowship.</p>

<p>How gently Christ deals with the backslider!
When John the Baptist temporarily wavered
in his conception of the mission of the Christ,
and sent his disciples to Jesus to ask, "Art
thou he that should come, or look we for another?"
how tenderly Christ dealt with His
forerunner! The circumstances in the case
might have led us to expect harsh treatment.
John had seen the open heavens and heard the
voice of God saying, "This is my beloved Son."
In a special and miraculous way it had been
revealed to John that Jesus was the Messiah,
"the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin
of the world!" The people had looked upon
John as a prophet. All that he had said concerning
the Christ they had believed, and now
from the forerunner of Christ comes this message
of doubt repeated to Jesus within the
hearing of the multitudes. But that child of
the desert had been incarcerated for some time
in a narrow prison cell. No wonder the eyes
of the caged eagle began to film, and the faith
of the stern prophet began to waver. Other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[<i>Page</i> 40]</a></span>
great men have wavered in their faith before
John. David himself said, even though God
had definitely promised that he should succeed
Saul as king, "I shall one day perish by the
hand of Saul." Elijah, after his great triumph
over the four hundred prophets of Baal, sat
down under a juniper tree, and full of fear
because of Jezebel's threat asked disconsolately
that he might die. No wonder then
that, momentarily, the faith of John the Baptist
was in the shadow. You and I have failed
in faith amid circumstances less trying than
those which surrounded John the Baptist in
his dungeon.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>The Gentleness of the Shepherd</i></b></div>

<p>How does Jesus answer John?
Does He curse the doubter?
No. That would not be like
Him. He has never been
known to do that. Not once, so far as we
know, did he ever send a message of censure
to a soul in the dungeon of darkness, doubt,
and despair. We have seen Him blast, with
the lightning of His eloquence, the false pride
of scribe and Pharisee who stood before Him
in haughtiness and scorn, but we never knew
Him to say a harsh word to a creature that was
sore stricken in soul. No, "He will not break
the bruised reed, nor quench the smoking flax."
No, He will not send a curse; He will send a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[<i>Page</i> 41]</a></span>
blessing. That will be more like Him. He
will say, "Go tell John again those things that
ye do see and hear; the blind receive their
sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed,
the dead are raised, the poor are evangelized,
and <i>blessed</i> is he that shall not be offended in
me." Not a curse, but a blessing will He send.</p>

<p>How much like his treatment of us! Do we
not remember when we first came to Him as
our Saviour, how He forgave, freely and
gladly, all our sins, and sent us on our way
rejoicing? Do we not recall how shortly after,
when we had sinned and spotted the clean
white sheet of paper He had given us, that
when we brought it back to Him all spotted
with sin He freely pardoned, gave us another
clean sheet, and, without upbraiding, sent us
away, saying, "Thy sins are forgiven; sin no
more"? Yes, we recall it. We believe in the
deity of Christ, not because of the metaphysical
arguments that have been produced to
prove it, no matter how elaborately stated or
eloquently discussed; not because our library
shelves are groaning beneath the weight of
evidences of His deity; nor because theologians
are said to have forced Him to that
high eminence. We believe Jesus Christ to be
God because when we sinned and came asking
pardon He freely forgave, and gave us a
clean sheet of acquittal, saying "Thy sins are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[<i>Page</i> 42]</a></span>
forgiven; go and sin no more," and then when
we did sin again and brought back the sheet
of paper all blotted over with sin and said we
were sorry and again asked pardon, He freely
forgave, and without chiding sent us on our
way rejoicing. That is what makes us believe
in Him as the Son of God and love Him with
a love surpassing expression.</p>

<p>May I not remind you of the Master's own
parable, "What man of you, having one hundred
sheep, if he lose one of them, doth not
leave ninety and nine in the wilderness, and
go after that which has gone astray, until

<i>until he find it</i>? He will not cease the search

that the first verse of this Psalm may be translated,
"The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is my Shepherd, I shall not
be <i>missing</i>." "O love that will not let me go."</p>

<p>The Shepherd stands at the door of the
sheepfold and counts the sheep, his one hundred
sheep. He counts to ninety-nine. One is
missing. He cannot rest until that last one is
found. The door of the sheepfold is closed,
and out into the darkness and cold and pain
of the night the shepherd goes until he finds
his lost sheep, and on his shoulders he carries
it back to the fold, then calls upon his neighbors
to rejoice with him. He has found his
lost sheep.</p>

<p>These words are strikingly significant, and
show forth the tender aspect of God's guidance.
Ofttimes, after rain, the heavy wagon
wheels would leave deep ruts in the road,
which in cold weather would become hardened
and make it difficult for the sheep to walk. Not
such roads did the true shepherd willingly
choose for his sheep. If compelled, however,
to take such roads, he would choose those that
had been flattened down by wagon wheels
until level. He chose those roads that had been
worn smooth, that the tender feet of the sheep
might not be bruised. "He leadeth me in
smooth roads." "Thou didst sustain them in
the wilderness; their feet swelled not."</p>

<p>He who follows the divine leading will
always be led aright. His feet will travel in
"right roads." No man will go wrong who
follows Christ. He never leads the soul into
questionable places, and no feet guided by Him
will go into any place where He Himself does
not go. "Where I am, there shall my servant
be." "He that followeth me shall not walk in
darkness." "God is light, and in him is no
darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship
with him, and walk in darkness, we lie,
and do not the truth." Sometimes the road
He chooses may not be after our liking, but it
will always be for our best interest, welfare
and usefulness. This fact will eventually be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[<i>Page</i> 48]</a></span>

<div class="sidenote">"<b><i>His Name's Sake</i></b>"</div>

<p>All this He does for His name's
sake. How beautiful those words
are, "<i>for His name's sake</i>." Christ's
own glory is involved in the
security and care of His children. The physician
cares for your child who is sick unto
death, for your sake, it is true, but for "his
own name's sake" as well. To lose your
child would hurt his reputation and practice.
The lawyer protects his client for his client's
sake, it is true, but also, and perhaps more so,
for "his own name's sake." To lose the case
would be to hurt his standing in the legal profession.
The pilot guides the ship safely into
harbor for the passengers' sake, it is true, but
more particularly for "his own name's sake,"
for to lose the ship would be to lose his license.</p>

<p>We remember that Jesus said, "Father, I
will that they also, whom thou hast given me,
be with me where I am, that they may behold
my glory." He also said, "And of all that thou
hast given me, I have lost none." Christ Himself
is the door. His broad figure and bulk fills
it. Who shall strip Him of His power, or rob
Him of His sheep? He is the secret of the security
of the believer; yea, He is the security
itself. We are hid in Him. It is rather the perseverance
of the Christ than of the believer.
Here, then, is the security of the believer, saved
and kept for "His own name's sake."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[<i>Page</i> 50]</a></span></p>

<p>How proud we are of someone who is named
after us! We have more solicitude and care
for the child that carries our name than for
other children. <i>For His name's sake</i>, therefore,
is an indication of the intense, intimate
interest and care of the Christ for His people.
Do we not recall what Moses said to Jehovah
when He said He thought to destroy the
people of Israel? Did not Moses plead thus
with God, "If thou dost destroy them, what
shall we say to the nations, and what wilt
thou do for thine own name's sake?"</p>

<p>Shall it not be that in that great day not
one of Christ's sheep will be missing? "My
sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and
they follow me; and I give unto them eternal
life; and they shall never perish, neither shall
any man pluck them out of my hand. My
Father, which gave them me, is greater than

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>Knowing God's Will</i></b></div>

<p>God's way of guidance varies
with different individuals. There
is probably no point on which
we need more careful instruction
than that which concerns the will of God
for us. We may speak of two wills of God.
The first concerns our <i>character</i> and may be
known by all, for it is distinctly declared in
the Word of God in such passages, for example,
as, "This is the will of God, even your
sanctification." There can be no doubt or hesitancy
with regard to knowing what the <i>general</i>
will of God regarding our <i>character</i> may
be.</p>

<p>There is another will of God, however, which
affects not our character but our <i>career</i>. This
<i>particular</i> will of God is not as easy to dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[<i>Page</i> 53]</a></span>cern
as that which touches our character.
Others may not know this for me. In the last
analysis God and I alone must solve the problem
of my career. It is true I may consult
others and get all the light possible on the
question at issue, but ultimately the solution
of the matter is to be found in the quiet with
the soul and God Himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>Three Things About Guidance</i></b></div>

<p>Three things may be said to indicate
clearly the <i>particular</i> will
of God which concerns my
<i>career</i>.</p>

<p>The first comes from a constant and prayerful
reading of the <i>Word of God</i>, through which
God will in some way make known to me in
particular His will regarding me. The scripture
which decides the matter for me may not
have the same meaning to others, but I recognize
it to be God's will for me. A minister received
one day two calls to the pastorate of
two churches. One offered a stipend of $3000
a year and manse, and an established church
with 900 members, and located under the
shadow of a great university. A flattering
call indeed. The other invitation was from a
struggling suburban church with a membership
of 75, and offering a salary of $1800 a
year. What should the minister do? Which
call should he accept? To say there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[<i>Page</i> 54]</a></span>
struggle in the heart at the time would be to
belie the fact. The man of God took the two
invitations, laid them on the bed, knelt by its
side, and put his open Bible in front of him between
the two letters. After prayer for guidance
and after reading the Word for some time
his attention was riveted upon this verse:
"Set not your mind on high things, but condescend
to them that are lowly" (Romans
12:16, R. V.). He had read that verse before,
many times, but somehow he could not get
beyond it at <i>this</i> time. To <i>him</i> at <i>that particular
time</i> it was indicative of God's will.
Obediently he chose the smaller church. After
years proved the wisdom of the choice. So
God will in some way indicate to you through
the reading of His Word His will for <i>you</i> at
<i>that time</i>.</p>

<p>The second element in discerning the will of
God is what may be called <i>the inward impression</i>,
by which we mean the constant, irrepressible,
insistent, persistent conviction in the
heart of the child of God that he ought to
do thus and so in a given case. It often happens
that a strong impulse comes to a child
of God. In a day or two that impulse has
passed away, and he looks back and sees that
he has no assurance that such was the will of
God for him; but to the obedient soul in communion
with the heavenly Father, the con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[<i>Page</i> 55]</a></span>stant,
irrepressible, insistent and persistent
conviction that a certain thing should or should
not be done is one of the sure indications of
God's voice in the soul.</p>

<p>The third feature in discerning the will of
God is what may be called <i>the favorable circumstance</i>,
or <i>the open door</i>. If God wants
one to go to a certain place or do a certain
thing, the opportunity to do it will be present
with the call to do it. If it is not, then one
should wait until the door opens. If the pillar
of cloud by day or the pillar of fire by night
remains stationary, then Israel must remain
in the camp. When these emblems of God's
guidance lifted and moved, then Israel knew
that it was time for them to move.</p>

<span class="i0">Which I have loved long since and lost awhile.<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>These three things, the Word of God, the inward
impression, and the open door, should
be present in every clear indication of the will
of God. If any one of them is missing, it indicates
that the will of God is not yet clear.
We have a beautiful illustration of these three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[<i>Page</i> 56]</a></span>
things in the call of Peter to admit Cornelius
into the Church (Acts 10 and 11). First, Peter
had the <i>Word of God</i>&mdash;nothing should be regarded
common or unclean; second, he had
<i>the inward impression</i>&mdash;he was meditating on
what the vision he had seen should mean; and
third, there was <i>the open door</i>&mdash;three men
were already waiting for him to convey him
to Cæsarea.</p>

<p>Wonderfully instructive is God's guidance
of the children of Israel by the pillar of cloud
by day and the pillar of fire by night. In this
connection we should recall the words of Jesus
when in the Temple, at the time they were
celebrating God's care for His people in the
wilderness in providing them with the pillar
of cloud and the pillar of fire. He said, "I am
the light of the world; he that followeth me
shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the
light of life." Christ is our Guide; the Word
of God is our chart. Having them, we may
rest assured that God who has guided His
people in all the ages will guide us safely to
the end.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FOUR</h2>

<h3>
<b>"Yea, though I walk through the valley of the<br />
shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for<br />
thou art with me; thy rod and<br />
thy staff they comfort me."</b>
</h3>


<p class="dropcap">It was necessary for shepherds in Palestine,
when leading their flocks from one
pasture to another, to lead them, at times,
through dark ravines, on either side of which
were caves and holes wherein dwelt ravenous
beasts. From the attack of these beasts the
shepherd must protect his flock. For this purpose
he used the staff which he carried with
him. The staff was a great stick with a large
knob at the end of it pierced through with
sharp nails and spikes. This weapon was used
to beat off the attacks of the wild beasts. The
shepherd must be bold and courageous. We
recall how David referred to his encounters
with wild beasts which attacked his flock. "And
David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his
father's sheep, and there came a lion, and a
bear, and took a lamb out of the flock; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[<i>Page</i> 59]</a></span>
I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered
it out of his mouth; and when he arose
against me, I caught him by his beard, and
smote him, and slew him. Thy servant slew
both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised
Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing
he hath defied the armies of the living God.
David said moreover, The Lord that delivered
me out of the paw of the lion, and out of the
paw of the bear, he will deliver me out of the
hand of the Philistine. And Saul said unto
David, Go, and the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> be with thee" (I
Samuel 17:34-37).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>The Valley of the Shadow</i></b></div>

<p>"The valley of the shadow of
death" may refer to any dark,
dread or awful experience
through which the child of God
is called to pass. In this sense it is used in
many places in the Scriptures. The Christian's
path is not always beside still waters and in
green pastures.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In pastures green? Not always; sometimes He<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who knoweth best, in kindness leadeth me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In weary ways, where heavy shadows be.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And by still waters? No not always so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ofttimes the heavy tempests round me blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And o'er my soul the waves and billows go.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[<i>Page</i> 60]</a></span><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">But when the storm beats loudest, and I cry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aloud for help, the Master standeth by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And whispers to my soul, "Lo, it is I!"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Above the tempest wild I hear Him say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Beyond the darkness lies the perfect day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In every path of thine I lead the way."<br /></span>
</div><div class="signature">&mdash;<i>Henry H. Barry</i><br />
</div></div>

<p>But is it not kind of our Father that He
puts the valley in the middle of the Psalm&mdash;not
at the beginning of our Christian journey,
lest we should be unduly discouraged, but in
the middle&mdash;after we have been strengthened
with food and drink and have been assured of
the tender care and guidance of the Great
Shepherd. Oh! wondrous thought and care!</p>

<p>Of course, "the valley of the shadow of
death" refers also, and probably more particularly,
to the experience of death itself. At
least we have come to look upon it in such
light, and doubtless thousands of God's people
have found the comforting truth of this verse
a safe pillow in the dying hour. It has lightened
the valley, removed the fear of death,
and illumined immortality.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>The Fear of Death</i></b></div>

<p>When a robber would scatter
a flock of sheep and cause fear
and consternation he throws a
dead carcass in the midst of
the flock. Sheep fear nothing as much as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[<i>Page</i> 61]</a></span>
sight of death. Is this not true of man also?
About the last fear taken from the human
heart is "the fear of death." "The last enemy
that shall be destroyed is death." Even though
the believer knows that the sting of death has
been removed, nevertheless there is usually
an attendant fear connected with the passing
out of this life.</p>

<p>I have read that a famous scientist was in
the habit of visiting a zoological garden in
London. Among the many things that always
interested him was a large snake&mdash;a boa constrictor.
It was kept in a large glass case so
that inspection of the reptile was perfectly safe
from the outside. The scientist, we are told,
was in the habit of knocking on the glass in
order to awaken the snake. Instantly, when
the knock was heard, the snake would raise
its head and strike at the glass with its fangs.
The scientist, instinctively shrank back, fearful
of being struck, though he knew there was
absolutely no danger. So sometimes is it with
the believer's relationship to death. Even
though he knows the sting is removed, nevertheless
the experience of death is somewhat
of a dread. The soul naturally recoils at the
thought of death.</p>

<p>No really thoughtful man will speak lightly
of death. He may, as some men may, in the
fullness of health and vigor, laugh at the idea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[<i>Page</i> 62]</a></span>
of dying; but when he comes face to face with
the real experience, there is, as any minister or
physician will tell you, quite a different story
to tell.</p>

<p>It reminds me of an experience in our own
family life. Behind a former residence of ours
was a stretch of woods where, after school, our
boys would go to play their outdoor games.
It was the understanding in the home that
when the whistle was blown or some other
signal given the boys should come home for
their meals. At times the boys would come
home in response to the signal in a somewhat
murmuring spirit. They have said something
like this to their mother: "Mother, what did
you call us home for anyway? Didn't you
know that we were just in the midst of a great
game and our side was about to win? We wish
you wouldn't call us." I have felt as I have
listened to them speaking thus to their mother
that, just at that particular time and in the
middle of the day, they could, apparently, get
along very well without their mother. But I
have noticed this also, that at night time, after
their mother had prayed with them and the
lights were turned out, there was another
story to tell. It seems to me that I can still
hear one of the boys calling out in the dark to
his mother, "Mamma, are you there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, son."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[<i>Page</i> 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mamma."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Is your face turned towards me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Mamma, will you hold my hand? It's dark,
isn't it, Mamma? Good night, Mamma."</p>

<p>Ah, yes, in the day-time they might think
they could get along very well without their
mother, but when the night comes, and the
lights are all out, and it's dark, then nobody
on earth but mother will do.</p>

<p>So it is with you, my friend. In your bravado
of health and strength you may say that
you are not afraid of death, but you wait until
your feet come down to the brink of the river;
then there will be a different story to tell.
Some men haven't much use for God in life,
but nobody else but God will do in the hour
of death.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>The Valley Is Certain and Narrow</i></b></div>

<p>Death is certain. It is appointed
unto men once to die. While
the Lord tarries, every child of
Adam will have to pass through
the experience of death.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">There is no flock, however watched and tended,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But one dead lamb is there!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is no fireside, howsoe'er defended,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But has one vacant chair!<br /></span>
</div><div class="signature">&mdash;<i>Henry W. Longfellow</i><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[<i>Page</i> 64]</a></span></div></div>

<p>We cannot bribe death. We cannot avoid
or evade passing through the valley of the
shadow. We cannot dig under it, nor tunnel
around it, nor fly over it. Face it we must.
It behooves us, therefore, to make sure that we
have the light and the life which alone will
secure for us a happy exit from this valley
and a glorious entrance into the unfading light
of a new day.</p>

<p>The valley of the shadow of death is narrow,
very narrow&mdash;so narrow indeed that even a
mother cannot take her one-hour-old babe
with her. It is so narrow. She must go through
the valley alone. Single file, if you please, is
the order of march through this valley of the
shadow. An aged woman lay dying. By her
bedside, with his hand in hers, sat the man
who for over fifty years had been her husband.
The light was failing fast, and eternity drawing
near to the aged woman. Grasping the
hand of her husband tightly, she said, "John,
it's getting dark. Take my hand. For over
fifty years we have traveled together, and you
have led me. Now it's getting dark, and I
cannot see the way. John, come with me, won't
you?"</p>

<p>But John could not go, and with tear-filled
eyes and trembling voice, he said, "Anna, I
cannot, cannot go. Only Jesus can go with
you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[<i>Page</i> 65]</a></span></p>

<p>She was a little girl of ten years. The angel
of death was hovering over her bed. The end
was drawing near. She said to her father, who
was standing by the mother's side at the bed,
"Papa, it's getting dark and I cannot see. Will
you please go with me?"</p>

<p>With heart breaking, the father had to say,
"Child, I cannot, I cannot go with you."</p>

<p>The girl turned to her mother and said,
"Mamma, then you will, won't you?"</p>

<p>But the mother, in turn, amid her tears, replied,
"Child, I would, but I cannot. Only
Jesus can go with you."</p>

<div class="sidenote"><b><i>The Personal Pronouns Change</i></b></div>

<p>It is interesting to note the
change in the personal pronoun
in this verse. Up to this point
the Psalmist has been speaking
in the third person and using the personal pronoun
"He"&mdash;"<i>He</i> leadeth me." "<i>He</i> maketh
me." "He restoreth;" <i>he, he, he</i>. When he
comes to speak of the valley of the shadow
of death, however, the third personal pronoun
is changed to that of the second person, "Yea,
though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evil; for <i>thou</i>,
(<i>thou</i>&mdash;not <i>he</i>, is with me, but <i>thou</i>) art with
me." There is no room for a third person in
this valley. If one does not have Christ as
Saviour and Guide in the dark hour of death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[<i>Page</i> 66]</a></span>
he goes through the valley of the shadow all
alone. Surely, without Christ with him man
will stumble and fall in this valley.</p>

<p>Poor indeed is that soul who, when his feet
are about to enter the valley, has no Guide, or,
when he comes to the brink of death's river,
has no Pilot.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Oh, to have no Christ, no Saviour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How lonely life must be!<br /></span>

<p>But what a blessing and comfort it is for
those who know Christ as Saviour and Comforter,
to have the assurance that in that last
hour of life He is by their side to guide them.
It was doubtless this thought of the presence
of Christ that comforted Tennyson when he
wrote the words of that beautiful poem:</p>

<p>Some one has called the fourth verse of the
Psalm a song of the waters. Did you ever hear
singing on the water? There is something wonderful
about it. The water seems to take all
harshness out of the music, and puts something
exquisitely beautiful into it. Here then
is "a psalm of the waters," a song for the believer
to sing when his feet are touching the
margin of the river: "When thou passest
through the waters, I will be with thee; and
through the rivers, they shall not overflow
thee.... For I am the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> thy God."</p>

<p>Here, too, is "a song in the night." Sing it,
Christian pilgrim, when earth's last hour is at
hand. Sing it as you enter the valley. Sing
it as the darkness deepens. Sing it when the
light of earth's day begins to fade. Sing it
when the earth is receding, heaven is opening
and God is calling you. Sing it until the glory
of the eternal morn breaks upon thine enraptured
vision. Sing it until your feet stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[<i>Page</i> 68]</a></span>
upon that golden shore against which death's
chilly wave never again shall dash, and where
death is no more. Sing it, sing this song of the
waters&mdash;"Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no
evil; for thou art with me; thy rod and thy
staff they comfort me."</p>

<div class="sidenote">"<b><i>Thy Rod and Thy Staff They Comfort Me</i></b>"</div>

<p>The rod is a protection from all
the adversaries of the night.
No enemy, not even the last
enemy, death, can affright the
soul in the care of the tender
Shepherd, for He has extracted the sting from
death. The staff is used for counting the sheep
as they pass one by one into the fold. This
action is sometimes called "passing under the
rod." The language used here indicates safety
and security.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ills have no weight and tears on bitterness.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.<br /></span>
</div><div class="signature">&mdash;<i>Henry F. Lyte</i><br />
</div></div>

<p>Christ hath <i>abolished</i> death and brought life
and immortality to light. The word "abolished"
is a very strong one in the Greek. It
has three root letters, a, r and g. Then the
preposition <i>kata</i> is added to it, thus making our
English word "energy" which means "a working
force." Then, in a way known to Greek
students, the preposition gives the word, as it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[<i>Page</i> 70]</a></span>
were, the force of a double negative. So the
Apostle teaches us that Christ, when He came
into the world and died on the cross, did something
with death. He double-twisted it, He
de-vitalized it, double-negatived it, made it
inoperative, rendered it powerless, so that ever
afterwards it would be unable to hurt the children
of God.</p>

<p>I do not know very much about bees except,
of course, that they sting. I am told, however,
that when a bee stings you it leaves its sting
in the wound and goes away to die. A little
child may play with the bee after it has stung
a person without any harm coming to the
child. The bee has lost its power to hurt. So
we are told that the sting of death is sin. Death
stung Christ on the cross and left its sting in
Him, so that ever after it could not hurt the
children of God. He is "Death of death and
hell's destruction."</p>

<p>Christ, the Great Shepherd, will be there at
the entrance of the valley to meet you and
lead you through. He will beat off all the
powers of death. He will destroy all the enemies
of darkness and convey you safely
through the valley into the Homeland. He
holds the keys of death and the grave. How
helpless a thing a sheep is! How much in need
of a defender it is! It seems as though almost
any other animal can defend itself. A dog will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[<i>Page</i> 71]</a></span>
fight when attacked. A sheep stands helpless
in the presence of its opponent. Christ, the
Good Shepherd, will protect to the last.</p>

<p>The comforting thoughts of this verse must
certainly take the sting out of death to those
who grasp the great truths taught here. It
surely abolishes death and illumines immortality.</p>

<p>No one need fear death with such thoughts
as these before him. The Apostle Paul asserts
that every believer in Christ has "a cheerful
view of death," and desires rather "to be absent
from the body and at home with the
Lord" than to remain here upon the earth.</p>

<p>Go to thy grave, not as the slave scourged
to his dungeon, or the dog whipped to his kennel,
but as the prince wraps around him the
drapery of his couch and lies down to pleasant
dreams. The conscious companionship of the
Christ will remove thy fears. With what
alacrity, courage and fearlessness doth he walk
the highway whose heart is honest and whose
conscience doth not convict him of the violation
of his country's laws! How different with
the criminal! How full of fear and apprehension!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

<h3>
<b>"Thou preparest a table before me in the<br />
presence of mine enemies; thou<br />
anointest my head with oil;<br />
my cup runneth over."</b>
</h3>


<p class="dropcap">There is a variety of senses in which
the truth of this verse may be understood.</p>

<p>It is said that in the ancient days a shepherd's
tent was a kind of city of refuge. The
man who had unwittingly slain another could
find refuge in a shepherd's tent from the
avenger of blood. The fugitive was permitted
to stay a given length of time within the shepherd's
care, during which time he was as safe
from the pursuer as though he were in the
actual city of refuge. The pursuer might be
raging with fury outside of the door of the tent,
but the fugitive could eat with perfect safety
and peace in the presence of his enemy. How
like Christ in His relation to the believer!</p>

<p>One day Charles Wesley stood looking out
of a partly open window at the fierce storm
howling without, when a young robin, quickly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[<i>Page</i> 74]</a></span>
passing some other birds, flew to his breast,
seeking shelter from its foes. It was then he
wrote that wonderful hymn, the opening words
of which are:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Jesus, Lover of my soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me to Thy bosom fly!<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Is not this a picture of this verse of the
Psalm? "And a man (Jesus Christ) shall be
for a hiding place and a refuge from the storm."
Are we not safe in Him from all our foes?
"There is therefore now no condemnation to
them that are in Christ Jesus."</p>

<p>We are told that in David's day it was the
custom of conquering kings and princes to
bring the royal captives of the contending defeated
army into a large banqueting house.
To each pillar in the house a prisoner of royal
blood or a commanding officer was chained.
The banquet tables were heavily laden with
good things of which the victors partook.
Feasting and jollification were indulged in,
and joy and gladness were manifest in the
presence of defeated and chained enemies. Are
we not made "always to triumph" over all our
foes in Christ? Are we not made "more than
conquerors" in Him who hath "led captivity
captive"? "Ye shall eat your meat in quietness,
and nothing shall make you afraid."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[<i>Page</i> 75]</a></span></p>

<p>Or, again, it may be that reference is made
in this verse to the grazing of sheep in fields
full of snakeholes or of poisonous plants. A
sheep raiser in Texas once told the writer that
he lost a great many sheep because snakes
would come up through holes in the ground
and bite the sheep as they grazed, poisoning
them. After losing many of the flock he finally
discovered a remedy. A mixture of some kind
was poured down the holes, which killed the
snakes, and after that the sheep were able to
graze in peace and safety. Hath not Christ
abolished death for the believer? Has He not
deprived death of its sting and stripped the
grave of its victim? Hath He not overcome
that old serpent, the Devil? Do we not overcome
the dragon, that old serpent, the Devil
and Satan, the accuser of the brethren day and
night&mdash;do we not overcome him by the blood
of the Lamb?</p>

<p>Whichever of these meanings may be
adopted as indicating the teaching of this verse,
we may be certain that the truth the Psalmist
desires to express is this: That God gives His
children victory over all their foes, and makes
them more than conquerors over all their
enemies. Thus shall we "eat our meat in peace
and quietness, and nothing shall make us
afraid." "Why do the heathen rage?...<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[<i>Page</i> 76]</a></span>
He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh"&mdash;and
so shall we.</p>

<p>A shepherd must needs be a
physician also. In the belt
of the shepherd medicines
are always carried. Sheep
are very susceptible to sicknesses
of many kinds, particularly fevers. Ofttimes
at night as the sheep passed into the fold
the shepherd's knowing eye would detect that
one or another of them was sick and feverish.
Perhaps it had been bitten by a serpent or torn
by some wild animal. He would take the feverish
sheep and plunge its head into clear, cold
water, plunging the head so far into the pail
that the water would run over, or anoint the
bruise with mollifying ointment. Doubtless
David is thinking of this experience of his
shepherd life.</p>

<p>Or, again, David may be referring to the
bountiful water supply provided for the sheep
and applying it to the rich provision God has
made for the believer. Not only is there grace
enough for oneself, but with the believer as a
channel, an abundance for others.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[<i>Page</i> 77]</a></span></p>

</div></div>

<p>This is the wonderful truth taught by Jesus
in the Temple: "Now on the last day, the great
day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying,
If any man thirst, let him come unto me and
drink. He that believeth on me, as the scripture
hath said, from within him shall flow
rivers of living water." Here we see how the
believer may come to Christ for the quenching
of his own thirst, and then draw on, or
drink more deeply of, Christ for the quenching
of the thirst of others. "Thou, O Christ,
art all I want, more than all in Thee I find."
Here we have the personal and relative side
of a consecrated life of service.</p>

<p>My cup is to "run over." No selfish religion
must I claim. I am to be satisfied with Christ
first myself, then I am to take from Him so
large a supply that others with whom I come
into contact may also partake of His fullness.
No hermit, no ascetic, monk, or recluse would
the Master have me be.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SIX</h2>

<h3>
<b>"Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me<br />
all the days of my life; and I will dwell<br />
in the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> for ever."</b>
</h3>


<p class="dropcap">The writer was once called to speak
with a Scotch Presbyterian elder who
was rapidly passing from this life. I
had read to him this last verse of the Psalm,
when, turning in his bed, he said to me in words
that were almost his last, "Take my Bible and
read that verse to me from 'The Psalms in
Metre' in the back of my Bible." I took his
Scotch Bible from a table close by and read:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Goodness and mercy all my life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall surely follow me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in God's house for evermore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My dwelling place shall be.<br /></span>
</div><div class="signature">&mdash;<i>William Whittingham</i><br />
</div></div>

<p>Some one has well said that "goodness and
mercy" are God's two collie dogs to preserve
the Christian from all danger. Others have
likened "goodness and mercy" to the Christian's
footmen to wait upon him daily. "The
house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span>" is doubtless here contrasted
with the tent of the shepherd, just as the words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[<i>Page</i> 80]</a></span>
"dwell for ever" are contrasted with the fact
that the fugitive was allowed to stay in the
shepherd's tent only a limited time.</p>

<p>This verse expresses the confidence of the
Christian with regard to the future. It is the
Christian's confidence that in the Father's
house a mansion is prepared for him, and that
when the earthly house of this tabernacle is
taken down and dissolved by death he has a
house not made with hands, eternal in the
heavens. This is surely a grand provision for
old age, a life insurance worthy of the name,
a home for the winter of life, and a blessed assurance
with regard to one's eternity. How
poor indeed is that soul that cannot say, "Yea,
though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I will fear no evil," for the
grave is not the terminus but the passageway
that leads to endless light and life, into the
glory and beauty of the house of the Lord in
which the believer shall "dwell for ever." Beyond
the night of death lies the perfect day;
beyond the valley of the shadow lie the plains
of peace.</p>

<p>One cannot help but wonder if you, reader,
have such a confident hope with regard to
your future life. Only those who are able to
say "The <span class="smcap">Lord</span> is my shepherd" are able to
say "I will dwell in the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> for
ever."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[<i>Page</i> 81]</a></span></p>

<p>A famous Scotch preacher tells us that a
demented boy, who was in the habit of attending
one of the classes in his Sunday school, was
sick unto death. The minister was asked to go
to see the boy. He went to the house, and in
speaking with the lad and after reading the
Scriptures he was about to leave, when this
boy, with only half his reasoning power, demented
and partly idiotic, asked the great
preacher if he wouldn't kneel down and recite
for him the Twenty-third Psalm. In
obedience to the boy's request he knelt and
repeated the Twenty-third Psalm, until he
came to the last verse which, as you know,
reads "Surely goodness and mercy shall follow
me all the days of my life, and I will
dwell in the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> for ever." But
the preacher did not repeat this last verse, for
he was saying to himself while on his knees,
"this verse can hardly be true of this boy,
surely goodness and mercy has not followed
him all the days of his life, and further, what
does he know about the determination of this
verse&mdash;to dwell in the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> for
ever?" And so the great preacher was rising
from his knees, having omitted the last verse,
when the boy reached out his hand and, placing
it on the shoulder of the minister, pressed
him again to his knees and repeated the last
verse of the Psalm&mdash;the verse the preacher<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[<i>Page</i> 82]</a></span>
had omitted, as it is written in the Scotch
hymn book:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Goodness and mercy all my life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall surely follow me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in God's house for evermore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My dwelling place shall be.<br /></span>
</div><div class="signature">&mdash;<i>William Whittingham</i><br />
</div></div>

<p>This was a lesson the preacher never forgot.
Can you, my reader, you, with all your senses,
your keenness of brain and intellect&mdash;can you
say what this idiotic boy could say: "I will
dwell in the house of the <span class="smcap">Lord</span> for ever"?</p>

<p>I am reminded in this connection of one of
Bunyan's characters in the "Pilgrim's Progress."
He is referred to as "Mr. Feeble Mind."
This character in speaking of his immortal
hope&mdash;that hope which lies beyond the valley
of the shadow and the grave&mdash;expresses
it in this way: "But this I am resolved on: to
run when I can, to go when I cannot run, and
to creep when I cannot go. As to the main, I
thank Him that loved me. I am fixed. My
way is before me. My mind is beyond the
river that hath no bridge, though I am, as you
see, but of a feeble mind." Mark that wonderful
expression, will you?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My mind is beyond the river that hath no bridge."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Is yours? You&mdash;man, woman, with all your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[<i>Page</i> 83]</a></span>
senses, of strong and sound mind, can you give
expression to an exclamation of faith like that?</p>

<p>There are some of my readers on whose head
time has laid its hand and whitened their hair
to the whiteness of that winter in which all
their glory must fade. Their sun of life is
going down beyond the hill of life. The young
may die; the old must die. Oh, the pity of it,
to see the old and gray with no eternal life
insurance for the winter of life! The gray head
is indeed a crown of glory if it be found in the
way of life; otherwise it is a fool's cap. Reader,
may your eventide be light, and may your path
be as the path of the just that shineth brighter
and brighter unto the perfect day!</p>

<p>Thus we see that the grave is not the end.
We pass through the grave only in order that
we may place our last climbing footstep upon
the threshold of our Father's house, to go out
no more. Then we shall dwell for ever there.
Beyond the grave lie the Plains of Peace, the
Homeland&mdash;with all the loved who have gone
before&mdash;those whom we "have loved long since
and lost awhile."</p>
